# rapids-retry
#
# retries a command 3 times after a non-zero exit, waiting 10 seconds
# between attempts. 3 times and 10 seconds are default values which can be
# configured with env vars described below.
#
#   NOTE: source this file to update your bash environment with the settings
#   below. Keep in mind that the calling environment will be modified, so do not
#   set or change the environment here unless the caller expects that.  Also
#   remember that "exit" will exit the calling shell!  Consider rewriting this
#   as a callable script if the functionality below needs to make changes to its
#   environment as a side-effect.
#
# Example usage:
# $ rapids-retry [--quiet] <command>
# $ rapids-retry conda install python
#
# To capture the output of the command rather than displaying it:
# $ output=$(rapids-retry --quiet gh run list --repo "myrepo/myproject")
#
# Configurable options are set using the following env vars:
#
# RAPIDS_RETRY_MAX       - set to a positive integer to set the max number of retry
#                          attempts (attempts after the initial try).
#                          Default is 3 retries
#
# RAPIDS_RETRY_SLEEP     - set to a positive integer to set the duration, in
#                          seconds, to wait between retries.
#                          Default is a 10 second sleep
#
# Additional options:
#
# --quiet                - when specified as the first argument after the command,
#                          captures the command's output instead of sending it to stdout.
#                          Logger messages are redirected to stderr.
#                          Returns the output of the command on success.
